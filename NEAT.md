Speaking of AI agents and systems and prompt engineering, here's a short summary of what
both NEAT and NEAT-Python are, generated by [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/):

# What is NEAT
NEAT (or *NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies*) is an evolutionary algorithm for creating
artificial neural networks, developed by Kenneth O. Stanley.

The key features of NEAT include:

- Evolves both the topology and weights of neural networks.
- Starts with simple networks and gradually increases complexity.
- Uses speciation to protect innovation and maintain diversity.
- Employs historical markings to enable crossover between different network topologies.

# What is NEAT-Python

[NEAT-Python](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a pure Python implementation
of the NEAT algorithm.

Its main characteristics are:

- Has no dependencies beyond the Python standard library.
- Supports Python versions 3.6 through 3.11, as well as PyPy 3.
- Provides a flexible framework for evolving neural networks for various tasks.
- Includes tools for visualizing network structures and tracking evolutionary progress.
- It's open-source and available on GitHub, with over 1,200 stars as of early 202512.

[NEAT-Python](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) allows users to define fitness functions,
set hyperparameters, and run evolutionary processes to solve problems ranging from simple control tasks
to more complex scenarios. It has been used in numerous academic research projects and serves as a
popular choice for those exploring neuroevolution techniques.

> Note: There's little point in going into more detail when plenty is already available on
the project's main page. There you will find detailed explanation of what each parameter is
intended for and how it's expected to affect the evolution of the neural network and thus the
model and performance of the trained model.

I have kept the original file with all the parameters grouped in the `config.txt` file for
reference only. The original - thus the updated application too, uses the `config.ini` file instead.
A selected few parameters could be changed from the GUI menu of the application and the change
will be persisted in the `config.ini` file too. Feel free to 'play and experiment' with some of
the other parameters.
